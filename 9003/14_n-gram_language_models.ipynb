    "In this notebook, we'll be building bigram *n*-gram language models from scratch. The first part of building a language model is collecting counts from corpora. To avoid problems with unknown words, we'll turn all *hapax legomena* (words that appear once) to UNK, and we'll also lower case everything and add `<s>` (start) and `</s>` (end) symbols at the beginning and end of each sentence. For bigrams, we are using dictionaries of dictionaries with the strings as keys, which is a convenient though not particularly memory efficient way to represent things. We will use the unigram counts later for doing smoothing."

We start with &lt;s&gt;, and generate the next word given the bigram counts which begin with &lt;s&gt;, and then use that word to generate the next word, etc. It stops when it generates an &lt;/s&gt;.

Across the two corpora, the sentences are noticeably different, it's very obvious that the model from Project Gutenberg is trained on literature, whereas the Penn Treebank data is financial. For the latter, there are some strange tokens (those starting with \\*) we should probably have filtered out; there are some UNK tokens, which is to be expected: there are a lot of words that appear only once which makes it a fairly common word type.\n",

In order to do that for anything but toy examples, however, we will need to smooth our models so it doesn't assign a zero probability to the sentence whenever it sees a bigram. Here, we'll test two fairly simple smoothing techniques, add-*k* smoothing and interpolated smoothing. For the latter, we'll control the trade-off between bigrams and unigrams with a simple parameter (bigram_lambda). In both cases, we will calculate the log probability, to avoid working with very small numbers. The functions below give the probability for a single word at index i in a sentence."
